# Actions
Show what you are doing on your computer on your GitHub readme or website!
## What is this?
This is a simple program that makes requests to an API to render a custom status showing what you are doing on your computer, just like this:<br>
<img src="https://actions.macedon.ga/get?uid=wmwjpzeplngkggbpimypbupyuujtwtrp"><br>
This is my status.
## API
[Endpoints](https://github.com/macedonga/actions/wiki/API-endpoints)
## Problems
- Since GitHub caches everything the status will not be updated in real time.
## Supported platforms
For now, only Windows...
## Want to add a program to the client?
Make an issue and I will add it as soon as possible
## Why does the client require administrator permissions?
To change the status when a program is opened or closes, the program needs to know when processes start and stop, and to do that, administrator permissions are required
