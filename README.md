# Actions
Show what you are doing on your computer on your GitHub readme or website!
## What is this?
This is a simple program that makes requests to an API to render a custom status showing what you are doing on your computer, just like this:<br>
<img src="https://actions.macedon.ga/get?uid=wmwjpzeplngkggbpimypbupyuujtwtrp"><br>
This is my status.
## Problems
- Since GitHub caches everything the status will not be updated in real time.
## Supported platforms
For now, only Windows...
## Want to add a program to the client?
Make an issue and I will add it as soon as possible
